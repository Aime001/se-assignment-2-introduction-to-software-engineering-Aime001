Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
There are 7 main phases of software Development Life Cycle as explained below:
1. Planning & Analysis:
in this initial phase, project planning occurs. Business requirements are gathered from clients or stakeholders.
Feasibility, revenue potential, cost of production, and end-user needs are evaluated.
Feature prioritization frameworks help decide what to build, what not to build, and what to prioritize
2. Define Requirements:
this phase is critical for converting information gathered during planning and analysis into clear requirements for the development team.
Requirements specify what the software must do, its functionalities, and user expectations.
3. Design
During design, the system architecture, components, and interfaces are planned.
Detailed technical specifications are created, including data models, algorithms, and user interfaces

4. Development
The actual coding and implementation of the software occur in this phase.
Developers write code based on the design specifications, following best practices and coding standards.
5. Testing
Software testing ensures that the product meets quality standards and functions correctly.
Different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) are performed to identify and fix defects.
6. Deployment
The software is deployed to production environments.
Installation, configuration, and user training take place.
Deployment can be gradual or immediate, depending on the project
7. Maintenance:
Post-deployment, ongoing maintenance and support are essential.
Bug fixes, updates, enhancements, and addressing user feedback occur during this phase.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall:is a linear, sequential project management method.
It is a: 
Linear Process: In Waterfall, there are well-defined stages (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) with formal hand-offs from one to the next.
Sequential: Each stage completes before the next begins.
Specific Requirements: Suited for large, complex projects with specific, unchanging requirements.
Risks: Less adaptable to changes; risks arise if requirements evolve during the project.
Agile:The Agile model is a flexible and iterative approach to software development. Here are its key characteristics:

Iterative Progress:
Agile emphasizes continuous feedback and adaptation.
Rapid Iteration: Agile emphasizes rapid, iterative cycles (Sprints).
Flexibility: Teams work concurrently on different phases.
Adaptability: Ideal for dynamic environments, evolving requirements, and frequent customer feedback.
Smaller Pieces: Breaks larger projects into smaller, manageable pieces.
Both models can be used as follow: 
Waterfall: Large, stable projects with fixed requirements.
Agile: Dynamic projects, startups, or when flexibility is crucial.
